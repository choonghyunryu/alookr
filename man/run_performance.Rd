\title{Apply calculate performance metrics for model evaluation}
\usage{
run_performance(model, actual = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model_df. results of predicted model that created by run_predict().}

\item{actual}{factor. A data of target variable to evaluate the model. It supports factor that has binary class.}
}
\value{
model_df. results of predicted model.
model_df is composed of tbl_df and contains the following variables.:
\itemize{
\item step : character. The current stage in the model fit process. The result of calling run_performance() is returned as "3.Performanced".
\item model_id : character. Type of fit model.
\item target : character. Name of target variable.
\item positive : character. Level of positive class of binary classification.
\item fitted_model : list. Fitted model object.
\item predicted : list. Predicted value by individual model. Each value has a predict_class class object.
\item performance : list. Calculate metrics by individual model. Each value has a numeric vector.
}
The performance metrics calculated are as follows.:
\itemize{
\item ZeroOneLoss : Normalized Zero-One Loss(Classification Error Loss).
\item Accuracy : Accuracy.
\item Precision : Precision.
\item Recall : Recall.
\item Sensitivity : Sensitivity.
\item Specificity : Specificity.
\item F1_Score : F1 Score.
\item Fbeta_Score : F-Beta Score.
\item LogLoss : Log loss / Cross-Entropy Loss.
\item AUC : Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC).
\item Gini : Gini Coefficient.
\item PRAUC : Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PR AUC).
\item LiftAUC : Area Under the Lift Chart.
\item GainAUC : Area Under the Gain Chart.
\item KS_Stat : Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic.

\description{
Apply calculate performance metrics for binary classification model evaluation.
}
\details{
run_performance() is performed in parallel when calculating the performance evaluation index. 
However, it is not supported in MS-Windows operating system and RStudio environment.
