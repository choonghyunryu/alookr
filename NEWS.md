# alookr 0.3.5
      
## BUG FIXES
  
* Fix error in glmnet when `run_predict()` is performed with test data that has more variables than train data.
    
    
    
# alookr 0.3.4
      
## MAJOR CHANGES
  
* add xgboosting methodlogy for binary classifier.
* add lasso regression model for binary classifier.      
      
     
 
# alookr 0.3.3
      
## BUG FIXES
  
* `run_predict()` fixed error when try to predict on dataset without the response variable 
    - (thanks @shivakhanal, #1).
    
## MINOR CHANGES
  
* `run_models()`, `run_predict()`, `run_performance()` not support future::multiprocess when running R from RStudio. 



# alookr 0.3.2
      
## BUG FIXES

* Fixed explanation errors in `Classification Modeling` vignettes for debian linux.
    
## MINOR CHANGES

* Renamed `compare_category()` to `compare_target_category()`. 
    - This is because it overlaps the function name of the dlookr package.
* Renamed `compare_numeric()` to `compare_target_numeric()`. 
    - This is because it overlaps the function name of the dlookr package.
* `compare_target_category()` modified from `is.tibble()`, `as.tibble()` to `is_tibble()`, `as_tibble()`.  
* `compare_diag()` modified from is.tibble(), as.tibble() to is_tibble(), as_tibble().  
* `sampling_target()` modified from as.tbl() to tibble::as_tibble().
