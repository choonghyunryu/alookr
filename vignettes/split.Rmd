The original data must be divided into train and test data sets to develop a classification model. You should do the following:

* Cleansing the data set
* **Split the data into a train set and a test set**

    + **Compare data set**
        + **Comparison of categorical variables**
        + **Comparison of numeric variables**
        + **Diagnosis of train set and test set**
    + **Extract train/test data set**  
        + **Extract train set or test set**
        + **Extract the data to fit the model**
* Modeling and Evaluate, Predict

The alookr package makes these steps fast and easy:
