## Preface
Once the data set is ready for model development, the model is fitted, predicted and evaluated in the following ways:

* Cleansing the dataset
* Split the data into a train set and a test set
* **Modeling and Evaluate, Predict**
    + **Modeling**
        + **Binary classification modeling**
    + **Evaluate the model**
        + **Predict test set using fitted model**
        + **Calculate the performance metric**
        + **Plot the ROC curve** 
        + **Tunning the cut-off**         
    + **Predict**
        + **Predict** 
        + **Predict with cut-off**  
        
The alookr package makes these steps fast and easy:
