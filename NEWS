CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.3.4:
      
  MAJOR CHANGES:
  
    * add xgboosting methodlogy for binary classifier.

    * add lasso regression model for binary classifier.      
      
     
 
CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.3.3:
      
  BUG FIXES:

    * run_predict() fixed error when try to predict on dataset without 
      the response variable (thanks @shivakhanal, #1).
    
  MINOR CHANGES:
  
    * run_models(), run_predict(), run_performance() not support 
      future::multiprocess when running R from RStudio. 



CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.3.2:
      
  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed explanation errors in `Classification Modeling` vignettes 
      for debian linux.
    
  MINOR CHANGES:

    * Renamed compare_category() to compare_target_category(). 
      This is because it overlaps the function name of the dlookr package.
    
    * Renamed compare_numeric() to compare_target_numeric(). 
      This is because it overlaps the function name of the dlookr package.
      
    * compare_target_category() modified from is.tibble(), 
      as.tibble() to is_tibble(), as_tibble().  
      
    * compare_diag() modified from is.tibble(), as.tibble() to 
      is_tibble(), as_tibble().  

    * sampling_target() modified from as.tbl() to tibble::as_tibble().
