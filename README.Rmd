## Overview

Binary classification modeling with `alookr`.

Features:

  - Clean and split data sets to train and test.
  - Create several representative models.
  - Evaluate the performance of the model to select the best model.
  - Support the entire process of developing a binary classification model.

The name `alookr` comes from `looking at the analytics process` in the data analysis process.

## Install alookr

The released version is available on CRAN. but not yet.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("alookr")
```

Or you can get the development version without vignettes from GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("choonghyunryu/alookr")
```

Or you can get the development version with vignettes from GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("ISLR", "spelling", "mlbench"))
devtools::install_github("choonghyunryu/alookr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Usage

alookr includes several vignette files, which we use throughout the documentation.

Provided vignettes is as follows.

* Cleansing the dataset
* Split the data into a train set and a test set
* Modeling and Evaluate, Predict

```{r vignettes, eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes(package = "alookr")
```

## Cleansing the dataset
### Data: create example dataset

To illustrate basic use of the alookr package, create the `data_exam` with sample function. The `data_exam` dataset include 5 variables.

variables are as follows.:

* `id` : character
* `year`: character
* `count`: numeric
* `alpha` : character
* `flag` : character

```{r create_data}
# create sample dataset
set.seed(123L)
id <- sapply(1:1000, function(x)
  paste(c(sample(letters, 5), x), collapse = ""))

year <- "2018"

set.seed(123L)
count <- sample(1:10, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)

set.seed(123L)
alpha <- sample(letters, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)

set.seed(123L)
flag <- sample(c("Y", "N"), size = 1000, prob = c(0.1, 0.9), replace = TRUE)

data_exam <- data.frame(id, year, count, alpha, flag, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# structure of dataset
str(data_exam)

# summary of dataset
summary(data_exam)
```

### Clean dataset
`cleanse()` cleans up the dataset before fitting the classification model.

The function of cleanse() is as follows.:

* remove variables whose unique value is one
* remove variables with high unique rate
* converts character variables to factor
* remove variables with missing value

#### Cleanse dataset with `cleanse()`
For example, we can cleanse all variables in `data_exam`:

```{r cleanse,}
library(alookr)

# cleansing dataset
newDat <- cleanse(data_exam)

# structure of cleansing dataset
str(newDat)
```

* `remove variables whose unique value is one` : The year variable has only one value, "2018". Not needed when fitting the model. So it was removed.
* `remove variables with high unique rate` : If the number of levels of categorical data is very large, it is not suitable for classification model. In this case, it is highly likely to be an identifier of the data. So, remove the categorical (or character) variable with a high value of the unique rate defined as "number of levels / number of observations". 
    + The unique rate of the id variable with the number of levels of 1000 is 1. This variable is the object of the removal by identifier.
    + The unique rate of the alpha variable is 0.026 and this variable is also removed.
* `converts character variables to factor` : The character type flag variable is converted to a factor type.

For example, we can not remove the categorical data that is removed by changing the threshold of the `unique rate`:

```{r cleanse_2}
# cleansing dataset
newDat <- cleanse(data_exam, uniq_thres = 0.03)

# structure of cleansing dataset
str(newDat)
```

The `alpha` variable was not removed.

If you do not want to apply a unique rate, you can set the value of the `uniq` argument to FALSE.:

```{r cleanse_3}
# cleansing dataset
newDat <- cleanse(data_exam, uniq = FALSE)

# structure of cleansing dataset
str(newDat)
```

If you do not want to force type conversion of a character variable to factor, you can set the value of the `char` argument to FALSE.:

```{r cleanse_4}
# cleansing dataset
newDat <- cleanse(data_exam, char = FALSE)

# structure of cleansing dataset
str(newDat)
```

If you want to remove a variable that contains missing values, specify the value of the `missing` argument as TRUE. The following example **removes the flag variable** that contains the missing value.

```{r cleanse_5}
data_exam$flag[1] <- NA 

# cleansing dataset
newDat <- cleanse(data_exam, missing = TRUE)

# structure of cleansing dataset
str(newDat)
```

### Diagnosis and removal of highly correlated variables

In the linear model, there is a multicollinearity if there is a strong correlation between independent variables. So it is better to remove one variable from a pair of variables where the correlation exists.

Even if it is not a linear model, removing one variable from a strongly correlated pair of variables can also reduce the overhead of the operation. It is also easy to interpret the model.

#### Cleanse dataset with `treatment_corr()`
`treatment_corr()` diagnose pairs of highly correlated variables or remove on of them.

`treatment_corr()` calculates correlation coefficient of pearson for numerical variable, and correlation coefficient of spearman for categorical variable.

For example, we can diagnosis and removal of highly correlated variables:

```{r treatment_corr}
# numerical variable
x1 <- 1:100
set.seed(12L)
x2 <- sample(1:3, size = 100, replace = TRUE) * x1 + rnorm(1)
set.seed(1234L)
x3 <- sample(1:2, size = 100, replace = TRUE) * x1 + rnorm(1)

# categorical variable
x4 <- factor(rep(letters[1:20], time = 5))
set.seed(100L)
x5 <- factor(rep(letters[1:20 + sample(1:6, size = 20, replace = TRUE)], time = 5))
set.seed(200L)
x6 <- factor(rep(letters[1:20 + sample(1:3, size = 20, replace = TRUE)], time = 5))
set.seed(300L)
x7 <- factor(sample(letters[1:5], size = 100, replace = TRUE))

exam <- data.frame(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7)
str(exam)
head(exam)

# default case
exam_01 <- treatment_corr(exam)
head(exam_01)

# not removing variables
treatment_corr(exam, treat = FALSE)

# Set a threshold to detecting variables when correlation greater then 0.9
treatment_corr(exam, corr_thres = 0.9, treat = FALSE)

# not verbose mode
exam_02 <- treatment_corr(exam, verbose = FALSE)
head(exam_02)
```

* `remove variables whose strong correlation` : x1, x4, x5 are removed.

## Split the data into a train set and a test set

### Data: Credit Card Default Data

`Default` of `ISLR package` is a simulated data set containing information on ten thousand customers. The aim here is to predict which customers will default on their credit card debt.

A data frame with 10000 observations on the following 4 variables.:

* `default` : factor. A factor with levels No and Yes indicating whether the customer defaulted on their debt
* `student`: factor. A factor with levels No and Yes indicating whether the customer is a student
* `balance`: numeric. The average balance that the customer has remaining on their credit card after making their monthly payment
* `income` : numeric. Income of customer

```{r create_data_2}
# Credit Card Default Data
head(ISLR::Default)

# structure of dataset
str(ISLR::Default)

# summary of dataset
summary(ISLR::Default)
```

### Split dataset
`split_by()` splits the data.frame or tbl_df into a training set and a test set.

#### Split dataset with `split_by()`
The `split_df` class is created, which contains the split information and criteria to separate the training and the test set.

```{r splits, message=FALSE}
library(alookr)
library(dplyr)

# Generate data for the example
sb <- ISLR::Default %>%
  split_by(default, seed = 6534)

sb
```

The attributes of the `split_df` class are as follows.:

* split_seed : integer. random seed used for splitting
* target : character. the name of the target variable
* binary : logical. whether the target variable is binary class
* minority : character. the name of the minority class
* majority : character. the name of the majority class
* minority_rate : numeric. the rate of the minority class
* majority_rate : numeric. the rate of the majority class

```{r attr}
attr_names <- names(attributes(sb))
attr_names

sb_attr <- attributes(sb)

# The third property, row.names, is excluded from the output because its length is very long.
sb_attr[!attr_names %in% "row.names"]
```

`summary()` summarizes the information of two datasets splitted by `split_by()`.

```{r summ}
summary(sb)
```


### Compare dataset
Train data and test data should be similar. If the two datasets are not similar, the performance of the predictive model may be reduced. 

`alookr` provides a function to compare the similarity between train dataset and test dataset.

If the two data sets are not similar, the train dataset and test dataset should be splitted again from the original data.

#### Comparison of categorical variables with `compare_target_category()`

Compare the statistics of the categorical variables of the train set and test set included in the "split_df" class.

```{r compare_target_category}
sb %>%
  compare_target_category()

# compare variables that are character data types.
sb %>%
  compare_target_category(add_character = TRUE)

# display marginal
sb %>%
  compare_target_category(margin = TRUE)

# student variable only
sb %>%
  compare_target_category(student)

sb %>%
  compare_target_category(student, margin = TRUE)
```

compare_target_category() returns tbl_df, where the variables have the following.:

* variable : character. categorical variable name
* level : factor. level of categorical variables
* train : numeric. the relative frequency of the level in the train set
* test : numeric. the relative frequency of the level in the test set
* abs_diff : numeric. the absolute value of the difference between two relative frequencies

#### Comparison of numeric variables with `compare_target_numeric()`

Compare the statistics of the numerical variables of the train set and test set included in the "split_df" class.

```{r compare_target_numeric}
sb %>%
  compare_target_numeric()

# balance variable only
sb %>%
  compare_target_numeric(balance)
```

compare_target_numeric() returns tbl_df, where the variables have the following.:

* variable : character. numeric variable name
* train_mean : numeric. arithmetic mean of train set
* test_mean : numeric. arithmetic mean of test set
* train_sd : numeric. standard deviation of train set
* test_sd : numeric. standard deviation of test set
* train_z : numeric. the arithmetic mean of the train set divided by the standard deviation
* test_z : numeric. the arithmetic mean of the test set divided by the standard deviation

#### Comparison plot with `compare_plot()`

Plot compare information of the train set and test set included in the "split_df" class.

```{r compare_plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=6, message=FALSE}
# income variable only
sb %>%
  compare_plot("income")

# all varibales
sb %>%
  compare_plot()
```

#### Diagnosis of train set and test set with `compare_diag()`

Diagnosis of similarity between datasets splitted by train set and set included in the "split_df" class.

```{r create_dataset}
defaults <- ISLR::Default
defaults$id <- seq(NROW(defaults))

set.seed(1)
defaults[sample(seq(NROW(defaults)), 3), "student"] <- NA
set.seed(2)
defaults[sample(seq(NROW(defaults)), 10), "balance"] <- NA

sb_2 <- defaults %>%
  split_by(default)

sb_2 %>%
  compare_diag()

sb_2 %>%
  compare_diag(add_character = TRUE)

sb_2 %>%
  compare_diag(uniq_thres = 0.0005)
```


### Extract train/test dataset
If you compare the train set with the test set and find that the two datasets are similar, extract the data from the split_df object.

#### Extract train set or test set with `extract_set()`

Extract train set or test set from split_df class object.

```{r extract_set}
train <- sb %>%
  extract_set(set = "train")

test <- sb %>%
  extract_set(set = "test")

dim(train)

dim(test)
```

#### Extract the data to fit the model with `sampling_target()`
In a target class, the ratio of the majority class to the minority class is not similar and the ratio of the minority class is very small, which is called the `imbalanced class`.

If target variable is an imbalanced class, the characteristics of the majority class are actively reflected in the model. This model implies an error in predicting the minority class as the majority class. So we have to make the train dataset a balanced class.

`sampling_target()` performs sampling on the train set of split_df to resolve the imbalanced class.

```{r sampling_target}
# under-sampling with random seed
under <- sb %>%
  sampling_target(seed = 1234L)

under %>%
  count(default)

# under-sampling with random seed, and minority class frequency is 40%
under40 <- sb %>%
  sampling_target(seed = 1234L, perc = 40)

under40 %>%
  count(default)

# over-sampling with random seed
over <- sb %>%
  sampling_target(method = "ubOver", seed = 1234L)

over %>%
  count(default)

# over-sampling with random seed, and k = 10
over10 <- sb %>%
  sampling_target(method = "ubOver", seed = 1234L, k = 10)

over10 %>%
  count(default)

# SMOTE with random seed
smote <- sb %>%
  sampling_target(method = "ubSMOTE", seed = 1234L)

smote %>%
  count(default)

# SMOTE with random seed, and perc.under = 250
smote250 <- sb %>%
  sampling_target(method = "ubSMOTE", seed = 1234L, perc.under = 250)

smote250 %>%
  count(default)
```

The argument that specifies the sampling method in sampling_target () is method. "ubUnder" is under-sampling, and "ubOver" is over-sampling, "ubSMOTE" is SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique).

## Modeling and Evaluate, Predict

### Data: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data
`BreastCancer` of `mlbench package` is a breast cancer data. The objective is to identify each of a number of benign or malignant classes. 

A data frame with 699 observations on 11 variables, one being a character variable, 9 being ordered or nominal, and 1 target class.:

* `Id` : character.	Sample code number
* `Cl.thickness` : ordered factor. Clump Thickness
* `Cell.size` :	ordered factor. Uniformity of Cell Size
* `Cell.shape` : ordered factor. Uniformity of Cell Shape
* `Marg.adhesion` :	ordered factor. Marginal Adhesion
* `Epith.c.size` : ordered factor. Single Epithelial Cell Size
* `Bare.nuclei` :	factor. Bare Nuclei
* `Bl.cromatin` :	factor. Bland Chromatin
* `Normal.nucleoli` :	factor. Normal Nucleoli
* `Mitoses` :	factor. Mitoses
* `Class` :	factor. Class. level is `benign` and `malignant`.

```{r load_data}
library(mlbench)
data(BreastCancer)

# class of each variables
sapply(BreastCancer, function(x) class(x)[1])
```

### Preperation the data
Perform data preprocessing as follows.:

* Find and imputate variables that contain missing values.
* Split the data into a train set and a test set.
* To solve the imbalanced class, perform sampling in the train set of raw data.
* Cleansing the dataset for classification modeling.

#### Fix the missing value with `dlookr::imputate_na()`
find the variables that include missing value. and imputate the missing value using imputate_na() in dlookr package.

```{r imputate_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dlookr)
library(dplyr)

# variable that have a missing value
diagnose(BreastCancer) %>%
  filter(missing_count > 0)

# imputation of missing value
breastCancer <- BreastCancer %>%
  mutate(Bare.nuclei = imputate_na(BreastCancer, Bare.nuclei, Class,
                         method = "mice", no_attrs = TRUE, print_flag = FALSE))
```

### Split data set
#### Splits the dataset into a train set and a test set with `split_by()`

`split_by()` in the alookr package splits the dataset into a train set and a test set.

The ratio argument of the `split_by()` function specifies the ratio of the train set.

`split_by()` creates a class object named split_df.

```{r split_data, warning=FALSE}
library(alookr)

# split the data into a train set and a test set by default arguments
sb <- breastCancer %>%
  split_by(target = Class)

# show the class name
class(sb)

# split the data into a train set and a test set by ratio = 0.6
tmp <- breastCancer %>%
  split_by(Class, ratio = 0.6)
```

The `summary()` function displays the following useful information about the split_df object:

* random seed : The random seed is the random seed used internally to separate the data
* split data : Information of splited data
    + train set count : number of train set 
    + test set count : number of test set
* target variable : Target variable name
    + minority class : name and ratio(In parentheses) of minority class
    + majority class : name and ratio(In parentheses) of majority class

```{r split_summary, warning=FALSE}
# summary() display the some information
summary(sb)

# summary() display the some information
summary(tmp)
```

#### Check missing levels in the train set

In the case of categorical variables, when a train set and a test set are separated, a specific level may be missing from the train set.

In this case, there is no problem when fitting the model, but an error occurs when predicting with the model you created. Therefore, preprocessing is performed to avoid missing data preprocessing.

In the following example, fortunately, there is no categorical variable that contains the missing levels in the train set.

```{r split_check, warning=FALSE}
# list of categorical variables in the train set that contain missing levels
nolevel_in_train <- sb %>%
  compare_target_category() %>% 
  filter(is.na(train)) %>% 
  select(variable) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  pull

nolevel_in_train

# if any of the categorical variables in the train set contain a missing level, 
# split them again.
while (length(nolevel_in_train) > 0) {
  sb <- breastCancer %>%
    split_by(Class)

  nolevel_in_train <- sb %>%
    compare_target_category() %>% 
    filter(is.na(train)) %>% 
    select(variable) %>% 
    unique() %>% 
    pull
}
```

### Handling the imbalanced classes data with `sampling_target()`

#### Issue of imbalanced classes data
Imbalanced classes(levels) data means that the number of one level of the frequency of the target variable is relatively small.
In general, the proportion of positive classes is relatively small. For example, in the model of predicting spam, the class of interest spam is less than non-spam.

Imbalanced classes data is a common problem in machine learning classification.

`table()` and `prop.table()` are traditionally useful functions for diagnosing imbalanced classes data. However, alookr's `summary()` is simpler and provides more information.

```{r show_ratio, warning=FALSE}
# train set frequency table - imbalanced classes data
table(sb$Class)

# train set relative frequency table - imbalanced classes data
prop.table(table(sb$Class))

# using summary function - imbalanced classes data
summary(sb)
```

#### Handling the imbalanced classes data

Most machine learning algorithms work best when the number of samples in each class are about equal. And most algorithms are designed to maximize accuracy and reduce error. So, we requre handling an imbalanced class problem.

sampling_target() performs sampling to solve an imbalanced classes data problem.

#### Resampling - oversample minority class
Oversampling can be defined as adding more copies of the minority class.

Oversampling is performed by specifying "ubOver" in the method argument of the `sampling_target()` function.

```{r sampling_over, warning=FALSE}
# to balanced by over sampling
train_over <- sb %>%
  sampling_target(method = "ubOver")

# frequency table 
table(train_over$Class)
```

#### Resampling - undersample majority class
Undersampling can be defined as removing some observations of the majority class.

Undersampling is performed by specifying "ubUnder" in the method argument of the `sampling_target()` function.

```{r sampling_under, warning=FALSE}
# to balanced by under sampling
train_under <- sb %>%
  sampling_target(method = "ubUnder")

# frequency table 
table(train_under$Class)
```

#### Generate synthetic samples - SMOTE
SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) uses a nearest neighbors algorithm to generate new and synthetic data. 

SMOTE is performed by specifying "ubSMOTE" in the method argument of the `sampling_target()` function.

```{r sampling_smote, warning=FALSE}
# to balanced by SMOTE
train_smote <- sb %>%
  sampling_target(seed = 1234L, method = "ubSMOTE")

# frequency table 
table(train_smote$Class)
```

### Cleansing the dataset for classification modeling with `cleanse()`
The `cleanse()` cleanse the dataset for classification modeling.

This function is useful when fit the classification model. This function does the following.:

* Remove the variable with only one value. 
* And remove variables that have a unique number of values relative to the number of observations for a character or categorical variable. 
    + In this case, it is a variable that corresponds to an identifier or an identifier. 
* And converts the character to factor.

In this example, The `cleanse()` function removed a variable ID with a high unique rate.

```{r clean_data, warning=FALSE}
# clean the training set
train <- train_smote %>%
  cleanse
```

### Extract test set for evaluation of the model with `extract_set()`

```{r extract_test, warning=FALSE}
# extract test set
test <- sb %>%
  extract_set(set = "test")
```

### Binary classification modeling with `run_models()`
`run_models()` performs some representative binary classification modeling using `split_df` object created by `split_by()`.

`run_models()` executes the process in parallel when fitting the model. However, it is not supported in MS-Windows operating system and RStudio environment.

Currently supported algorithms are as follows.:

* logistic : logistic regression using `stats` package
* rpart : Recursive Partitioning Trees using `rpart` package
* ctree : Conditional Inference Trees using `party` package
* randomForest :Classification with Random Forest using `randomForest` package
* ranger : A Fast Implementation of Random Forests using `ranger` package

`run_models()` returns a `model_df` class object.

The `model_df` class object contains the following variables.:

* step : character. The current stage in the classification modeling process.
    + For objects created with `run_models()`, the value of the variable is "1.Fitted".
* model_id : model identifiers
* target : name of target variable
* positive : positive class in target variable
* fitted_model : list. Fitted model object by model_id's algorithms


```{r fit_model, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
result <- train %>% 
  run_models(target = "Class", positive = "malignant")
result
```

### Evaluate the model
Evaluate the predictive performance of fitted models.

#### Predict test set using fitted model with `run_predict()`

`run_predict()` predict the test set using `model_df` class fitted by `run_models()`.

`run_predict ()` is executed in parallel when predicting by model. However, it is not supported in MS-Windows operating system and RStudio environment.

The `model_df` class object contains the following variables.:

* step : character. The current stage in the classification modeling process.
    + For objects created with `run_predict()`, the value of the variable is "2.Predicted".
* model_id : character. Type of fit model.
* target : character. Name of target variable.
* positive : character. Level of positive class of binary classification.
* fitted_model : list. Fitted model object by model_id's algorithms.
* predicted : result of predcit by each models

```{r predict}
pred <- result %>%
  run_predict(test)
pred
```

#### Calculate the performance metric with `run_performance()`

`run_performance()` calculate the performance metric of `model_df` class predicted by `run_predict()`.

`run_performance ()` is performed in parallel when calculating the performance evaluation index. However, it is not supported in MS-Windows operating system and RStudio environment.

The `model_df` class object contains the following variables.:

* step : character. The current stage in the classification modeling process.
    + For objects created with `run_performance()`, the value of the variable is "3.Performanced".
* model_id : character. Type of fit model.
* target : character. Name of target variable.
* positive : character. Level of positive class of binary classification.
* fitted_model : list. Fitted model object by model_id's algorithms
* predicted : list. Predicted value by individual model. Each value has a predict_class class object.
* performance : list. Calculate metrics by individual model. Each value has a numeric vector.

```{r performance1}
# Calculate performace metrics.
perf <- run_performance(pred)
perf
```

The performance variable contains a list object, which contains 15 performance metrics:

* ZeroOneLoss : Normalized Zero-One Loss(Classification Error Loss).
* Accuracy : Accuracy.
* Precision : Precision.
* Recall : Recall.
* Sensitivity : Sensitivity.
* Specificity : Specificity.
* F1_Score : F1 Score.
* Fbeta_Score : F-Beta Score.
* LogLoss : Log loss / Cross-Entropy Loss.
* AUC : Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC).
* Gini : Gini Coefficient.
* PRAUC : Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PR AUC).
* LiftAUC : Area Under the Lift Chart.
* GainAUC : Area Under the Gain Chart.
* KS_Stat : Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic.

```{r performance2}
# Performance by analytics models
performance <- perf$performance
names(performance) <- perf$model_id
performance
```

If you change the list object to tidy format, you'll see the following at a glance:

```{r performance3}
# Convert to matrix for compare performace.
sapply(performance, "c")
```

`compare_performance()` return a list object(results of compared model performance). and list has the following components:

* recommend_model : character. The name of the model that is recommended as the best among the various models.
* top_count : numeric. The number of best performing performance metrics by model.
* mean_rank : numeric. Average of ranking individual performance metrics by model.
* top_metric : list. The name of the performance metric with the best performance on individual performance metrics by model.

In this example, `compare_performance()` recommend the **"ranger"** model.

```{r compare_performance}
# Compaire the Performance metrics of each model
comp_perf <- compare_performance(pred)
comp_perf
```

#### Plot the ROC curve with `plot_performance()`

`compare_performance()` plot ROC curve.

```{r ROC, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
# Plot ROC curve
plot_performance(pred)
```


#### Tunning the cut-off

In general, if the prediction probability is greater than 0.5 in the binary classification model, it is predicted as `positive class`.
In other words, 0.5 is used for the cut-off value.
This applies to most model algorithms. However, in some cases, the performance can be tuned by changing the cut-off value.

`plot_cutoff ()` visualizes a plot to select the cut-off value, and returns the cut-off value.

```{r cutoff, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
pred_best <- pred %>% 
  filter(model_id == comp_perf$recommend_model) %>% 
  select(predicted) %>% 
  pull %>% 
  .[[1]] %>% 
  attr("pred_prob")

cutoff <- plot_cutoff(pred_best, test$Class, "malignant", type = "mcc")
cutoff

cutoff2 <- plot_cutoff(pred_best, test$Class, "malignant", type = "density")
cutoff2

cutoff3 <- plot_cutoff(pred_best, test$Class, "malignant", type = "prob")
cutoff3

#### Performance comparison between prediction and tuned cut-off with `performance_metric()`

Compare the performance of the original prediction with that of the tuned cut-off. 
Compare the cut-off with the non-cut model for the model with the best performance `comp_perf$recommend_model`.

```{r predit_cutoff}
comp_perf$recommend_model

# extract predicted probability
idx <- which(pred$model_id == comp_perf$recommend_model)
pred_prob <- attr(pred$predicted[[idx]], "pred_prob")

# or, extract predicted probability using dplyr
pred_prob <- pred %>% 
  filter(model_id == comp_perf$recommend_model) %>% 
  select(predicted) %>% 
  pull %>% 
  "[["(1) %>% 
  attr("pred_prob")

# predicted probability
pred_prob  

# compaire Accuracy
performance_metric(pred_prob, test$Class, "malignant", "Accuracy")
performance_metric(pred_prob, test$Class, "malignant", "Accuracy",
                   cutoff = cutoff)

# compaire Confusion Matrix
performance_metric(pred_prob, test$Class, "malignant", "ConfusionMatrix")
performance_metric(pred_prob, test$Class, "malignant", "ConfusionMatrix", 
                   cutoff = cutoff)

# compaire F1 Score
performance_metric(pred_prob, test$Class, "malignant", "F1_Score")
performance_metric(pred_prob, test$Class,  "malignant", "F1_Score", 
                   cutoff = cutoff)
performance_metric(pred_prob, test$Class,  "malignant", "F1_Score", 
                   cutoff = cutoff2)
```

If the performance of the tuned cut-off is good, use it as a cut-off to predict positives.

### Predict
If you have selected a good model from several models, then perform the prediction with that model.

#### Create data set for predict
Create sample data for predicting by extracting 100 samples from the data set used in the previous under sampling example.

```{r predit_data, warning=FALSE}
data_pred <- train_under %>% 
  cleanse 

set.seed(1234L)
data_pred <- data_pred %>% 
  nrow %>% 
  seq %>% 
  sample(size = 50) %>% 
  data_pred[., ]
```

#### Predict with alookr and dplyr
Do a predict using the `dplyr` package. The last `factor()` function eliminates unnecessary information.

```{r predit_final, warning=FALSE}
pred_actual <- pred %>%
  filter(model_id == comp_perf$recommend_model) %>% 
  run_predict(data_pred) %>% 
  select(predicted) %>% 
  pull %>% 
  "[["(1) %>% 
  factor()

pred_actual
```

If you want to predict by cut-off, specify the `cutoff` argument in the `run_predict()` function as follows.:

In the example, there is no difference between the results of using cut-off and not.

```{r predit_final2, warning=FALSE}
pred_actual2 <- pred %>%
  filter(model_id == comp_perf$recommend_model) %>% 
  run_predict(data_pred, cutoff) %>% 
  select(predicted) %>% 
  pull %>% 
  "[["(1) %>% 
  factor()

pred_actual2

sum(pred_actual != pred_actual2)
```
